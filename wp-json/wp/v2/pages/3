Thus, to process your personal information we need your consent. When completing the contact form in order to ask any question or request information, you accept out Privacy policy, and consent the processing of your personal data by Social Games, necessary in order to carry out the response to your request or question.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>\u00bfHOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR DATA?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Your personal data will be kept by Social Games during the period of legal prescription stipulated for actions that may arise.

Whenever you ask us to modify any of your inaccurate or incomplete data, you must indicate which data do you wish to be modified.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"151\">Right to object<\/td>\n<td width=\"875\">You can object any time to the processing of your personal data. Nonetheless, there are certain situations in which the law stablishes that you are not allowed to exercise this right (e.g. when the legal standing for the processing of your personal data is the performance of a contract or the fulfillment of a legal obligation for us). Except for these situations, you can object at any time to the processing of your personal data. So, this is a right that you can clearly exercise when the data processing is based in our legitimate interests. If you exercise this right, Social Games will stop processing your personal data, being able to anonymize or eliminate it, unless we prove that the legitimate grounds for the processing prevail over your interests, rights and freedoms, such as their preservation during a reasonable period of time for the exercise or defense of any claim.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"151\">Right to erasure<\/td>\n<td width=\"875\">This right allows you to cancel your personal data. This does not mean that your data is completely eliminated, but your data will be kept blocked in order to prevent the processing, without prejudice of making it available to the public administrations, judges and courts, for the attention of possible responsibilities that may have arisen from the processing during the prescription term. Once that period is over, your data will be duly anonymized or eliminated.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"151\">Right to data portability<\/td>\n<td width=\"875\">You have the right to receive your personal data, which you have provided to Social Games and transmit that data to another controller. It is only possible to exercise this right when the processing is based on the performance of a contract or in your consent and the processing is done by automatic means.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"151\">Right of restriction of processing<\/td>\n<td width=\"875\">This right allows you to request restriction or the suspension of processing of your personal data when:<\/p>\n<p>You have contested the accuracy of the personal data, for a period enabling Social Games to verify the accuracy of the personal data.<\/p>\n<p>You have exercised you right to object the processing of your data, while is verified that the legitimate interest of Social Games prevails over yours.<\/p>\n<p>Also, this right allows you to request Social Games to keep your personal data when:<\/p>\n<p>The processing is unlawful, and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and request the restriction of their use instead.<\/p>\n<p>Social Games no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"151\">\u00bfHow can you exercise your rights?<\/td>\n<td width=\"875\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can exercise your rights, sending your request to the following e-mail address: <a href=\"mailto:protecciondedatos@socialgamesonline.io\">protecciondedatos@socialgamesonline.io<\/a> or by post, identifying yourself in both cases, addressed to: Carretera Castellar, n\u00famero 338 08226 Terrassa (Barcelona)\u2013 Ref.
